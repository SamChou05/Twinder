# Twinder: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Elevator Pitch
Twinder is a location-based dating app for pairs of friends looking to meet other pairs. Instead of navigating the awkwardness of dating alone, Twinder lets two friends team up, create a duo profile, and swipe on other duos. When two duos match, they start a group chat, easing social barriers and making first encounters more comfortable.

## 2. Who Is This App For
- Young adults seeking a fun and less intimidating way to date.  
- Friends who enjoy doing activities and social events together.  
- Users who value a communal approach to meeting new people.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. **Individual Registration**  
   - Users sign up with their email to create a verified individual account.
2. **Duo Account Creation**  
   - Two verified individual users can create a shared duo profile.  
   - The duo profile includes photos (featuring both friends) and a joint bio.
3. **Location-Based Matching**  
   - Users swipe through a deck of nearby duo profiles.  
   - Matches are primarily based on location, with an age filter for the MVP.
4. **Messaging**  
   - When there’s a match, a group chat is created for all four users.  
   - One-on-one private chat is also available if individuals want to connect separately.
5. **Profile Management**  
   - Users can view and edit their individual profiles.  
   - Users can create and manage multiple duo profiles, each with a different friend.
6. **Core MVP Focus**  
   - Typical swipe deck design.  
   - Minimal friction to create or manage duo accounts once individual profiles are verified.  
   - No additional safety or privacy features beyond basic email verification (those will be addressed in a future phase).
